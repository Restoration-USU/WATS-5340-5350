#### Excercise Materials
* 
* Hydraulics: [Tyler Alred's Q2 and Q100 HEC-RAS-2D Depth Rasters](https://usu.box.com/v/Alred-HECRAS2D-LoganRiver-2016) - These were created based on 2015 LiDAR and [HEC-RAS](http://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-ras/)
* Geomorphic Units: [Logan River (Golf Course Road to 10th West) GUT 2.2.1 Project](https://usu.box.com/v/GUT-LoganRiver-City-2016-Aug) - This was run for the seven contiguous [CHaMP](http://champmonitoring.org) topographic surveys from August 2016 from Golf Course Road to 10 West. I used the Geomorphic Unit Toolkit ([GUT Version 2.2.1](https://github.com/Riverscapes/pyGUT/releases/tag/2.2.1)) individually on each reach and merged the inputs and outputs into one. If you want to run GUT yourself, see the [documentaton here](https://riverscapes.github.io/pyGUT/)
