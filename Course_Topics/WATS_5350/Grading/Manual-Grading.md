## 2021 & 2022 Grading Exercises

To accompany the lecture and for homework, please watch the lectures and pause when you get to each of these in the [PDF <i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/etalweb.joewheaton.org/Courses/WATS5350/2022/WATS5350_Module_02_Grading-Exercise.pdf)  and attempt to do these on your own by hand. If you keep watching, I show you how to do some of these.

The assignment includes 8 exercises:
1. Interpreting a simple Grading Plan (page 1) - where you demonstrate your understanding of a grading plan (bold finish contours) by:
    a. Drawing the Zero Line
    b. Coloring cut areas red and fill areas blue (leaving non grading areas clear)
    c. Denote the limits of grading
 2. Demonstrate your understanding of reading topography for Logan River by:
        a. Mapping all diffluences (D) and confluences (C)
      b. Addressing whether the number of confluences = diffluences (by counting)
      c. Mapping channel heads (H)
      d. Considering whether C = D + H
 3. Schematically showing what grading would result in an "avulsion"
 4. Grading a riffle crest and deepening a pool
 5. Regrading to remove an island and plug up a channel
 6. Identifying diagonal bar(s) and stage (slides 6 & 7)
 7. Turn a bank attached bar into a mid-channel bar by grading a chute cutoff
 8. Grading in a new diffluence

Each of the above requires you to be able to read the contour maps and interpret topography correctly, while also understanding enough of the geomorphic jargon to understand what is being asked of you.

You will turn a PDF of this assignment. That can be from digitally drawing on top of each page, or you can print it out and draw by hand and scan and turn in.
