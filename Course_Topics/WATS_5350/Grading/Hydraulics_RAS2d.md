## Hydraulic Simulation of 
Tyler Allred ([Allred Restoration](http://www.allred-restoration.com/)) was generous enough to prepare a Hydraulic model ([HEC-RAS2d](https://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-ras/)) of this year's restoration reach for us.

### Reference Resources

Here is expanded set of slides from a workshop Peter and Joe taught, where the grading excercise was extended to run a hydraulic model on.

If you wish to use the HEC-RAS 2D model yourself, you may find the West Consultants manual helpful:
