## Background

### Synopsis of Topic

Grading

### Why we're covering it

Most traditional restoration designs involve some degree of earth moving or grading. As such, we move from the conceptual design (planform specifications) of actions into specific instructions of what to build 

### Learning Outcomes

The primary learning outcomes in this unit you will achieve are:
1. Gain direct experience *applying* knowledge as a watershed scientist to working on real-world aquatic ecosystem **restoration and management problems** (e.g. stream restoration, watershed management,wetland restoration) with practitioners. 
4. Develop a working *understanding* of different aspects and approaches to **restoration design** and *create* two types of design and *evaluate* their ability to achieve project objectives. *Articulate* specific, testable **design hypotheses** for your own designs.

### Slides & Handouts



In the first week introduction, we covered a range of simple grading concepts through some in-class excercises.

In the second week, we went from the hand-drawn grading plan of your designs to learning how to produce a digital elevation model of your grading plan.
