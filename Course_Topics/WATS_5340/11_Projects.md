title: Design Alternatives Project
weight: 11
---

## Background

### Synopsis of Topic

Your primary project this semester will be to produce and preliminarily evaluate design alternatives for the restoration of the Golf Course Reach of the Logan River.

### Why we're covering it

To give you first hand experience in developing design alternatives on a real restoration project.

### Learning Outcomes

The main learning outcome met is number 4 below, but all of these apply in this project:

1. Gain direct experience *applying* knowledge as a watershed scientist to working on real-world aquatic ecosystem **restoration and management problems** (e.g. stream restoration, watershed management,wetland restoration) with practitioners. 
2. Build a working *understanding* of the typical **process** through which restoration projects are conceived, proposed, planned, permitted and conceptually designed. 
3. *Develop* a **vision for a restoration project** and *propose* that solution formally.
4. *Create* **conceptual design alternatives** for a specific restoration action.

### Some Helpful Videos of Area Flooding in 2017 High Flows

* *0:00 – 2:00 and 4:00 – end show flooding between 6th W (Park Ave) and 10th W on Kunzler (north of river), ICON and City properties (south of river). Video starts at 6th W looking east then pans north and west

* *The video starts at 10th W and pans briefly to the east showing flooding of Kunzler property east of the highway (ICON is large white building south of the river). A short portion of the video returns to this area (around 2:15) but most of it (2:15 - shows flooding of Kunzler properties west of 10th W (as well as flooding on ICON south of the river east of 10th W). The Logan River is outlined by the crack willow trees. At 3:30 you can see a small, straight drainage and small line of trees at the middle
