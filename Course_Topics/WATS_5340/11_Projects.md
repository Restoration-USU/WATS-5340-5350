title: Design Alternatives Project
weight: 11
---

## Background

### Synopsis of Topic

Your primary project this semester will be to produce and preliminarily evaluate design alternatives for the restoration of the Golf Course Reach of the Logan River.

### Why we're covering it

To give you first hand experience in developing design alternatives on a real restoration project.

### Learning Outcomes

The main learning outcome met is number 4 below, but all of these apply in this project:

1. Gain direct experience *applying* knowledge as a watershed scientist to working on real-world aquatic ecosystem **restoration and management problems** (e.g. stream restoration, watershed management,wetland restoration) with practitioners. 
2. Build a working *understanding* of the typical **process** through which restoration projects are conceived, proposed, planned, permitted and conceptually designed. 
3. *Develop* a **vision for a restoration project** and *propose* that solution formally.
4. *Create* **conceptual design alternatives** for a specific restoration action.
