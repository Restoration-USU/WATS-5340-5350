## Background

### Synopsis of Topic
For our first meeting, come prepared to role up your sleeves and work. We will meet in Huntsman Hall 126 and spend 30 minutes with a brief, overview of what we're trying to achieve in the course, review of syllabus, and talking about projects. 

We will then head out in to the field @ 2:00 and drive up Logan Canyon to Trail Creek and you will be thrown in the deep end on a real restoration project.   

### Why we're covering it
We need to spend the first 30 minutes just covering the syllabus and expectations for the course. The field trip is intended to immerse you deep (and somewhat arbitrarily) into a real restoration project. Throwing you right in to restoration implementation should raise all sorts of questions to you about why we're doing the restoration, how we got to the point of 'doing something', what was the process up to this point and what will be the process moving forward. This will be an excellent introduction to our focus for this course.

### Learning Outcomes
Gain direct experience *applying* knowledge as a watershed scientist to working on real-world aquatic ecosystem **restoration and management problems** (e.g. stream restoration, watershed management,wetland restoration) with practitioners. 

Moreover, you will learn how to build a postless BDA (beaver dam analogue).
