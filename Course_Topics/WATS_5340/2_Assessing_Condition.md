## Background

### Synopsis of Topic
There are many ways to define *restoration* and the related management actions we take to improve things. Regardless of the definition you subscribe to,  implicit in taking such *restoration* actions is the idea that current conditions are worse than either they were previously, or worse than they could be.  Condition can be described with simple qualitative categories (e.g. poor, moderate, good intact), descriptive categories (e.g. functioning properly, functioning at risk, impaired function; see 'watershed condition' inf figure below), or with some sort of continuous score (e.g. 0 to 100% departure from historic). Thus, most restoration actions are focused on improving current conditions towards something better. We will discuss developing appropriate targets for condition and analogues when we get into recovery potential in week 3.

Map from USFS's  National Inventory of 6th Level ([HUC12](https://water.usgs.gov/GIS/huc.html)) [Watershed Condition](https://www.fs.fed.us/biology/watershed/condition_framework.html) (from [Potyondy et al.](https://www.fs.fed.us/biology/resources/pubs/watershed/maps/Watershed_Condition_Framework2011FS977.pdf) (2011)).

However, it is critically important to be clear what we mean by condition. What geography is considered? Is it *watershed condition* (e.g.  [Potyondy et al.](https://www.fs.fed.us/biology/resources/pubs/watershed/maps/Watershed_Condition_Framework2011FS977.pdf) (2011); i.e. a polygon region), *reach condition* (e.g. Fryirs (2015) - *geomorphic condition*; and Brierley & Fryirs (2005)), or some other geography? Similarly, what *type* of condition are we talking about? Is this the condition of a particular population of species of concern (e.g. fish~ McHugh et al 2017; Wheaton et al. 2017) or that species *habitat condition* (e.g. beaver habitat - Macfarlane et al 2015)?  Is this some integrated measure of *ecosystem condition* or multiple species that are indicative of such condition (e.g.  *biotic integrity* censu Hawkins et al. 2000)? Are we concerned with *riparian conditions* (e.g. Macfarlane et al. 2016) or *wetland conditions* or *floodplain condition*? There are many lenses by which we can consider condition, and its important to be clear what specific aspect of condition we are considering. Moreover, different types of condition assessment can focus on specific impairments that might help give clues about what restoration actions might need to focus on.

### Why we're covering it
Although it is possible to just jump into restoration actions without a clear evaluation of condition or articulation of specifically what impairments are a problem, it is a far better to use condition assessment to more clearly define the problem. Depending on the methods of condition assessment used, the underlying  scores and intermediate outputs of such a process may more helpfully identify what specific impairments need attention.

### Learning Outcomes
Of the course [learning outcomes](https://restoration-usu.github.io/WATS-5340-5350/Syllabus/Learning_Outcomes.html), we are primarily focused this week on:

4. Identify* and *document* specific **watershed or ecosystem impairments** in relationship to pre-defined management objectives.

Secondarily, we will build towards:

3. Build a working *understanding* of the typical **process** through which restoration projects are conceived, proposed, planned, permitted and conceptually designed.
