The learning outcomes for the two capstone courses are related, and build on each other largely helping students understand and gain direct experience in the typical lifecycle of restoration projects.

### WATS 5340 - Capstone I

Learning Outcomes include:

1. <a id="5340_LO1"></a>  Gain direct experience *applying* knowledge as a watershed scientist to working on real-world aquatic ecosystem **restoration and management problems** (e.g. stream restoration, watershed management,wetland restoration) with practitioners. 
2. <a id="5340_LO2"></a>  Provide constructively critical *evaluations* of various aspects of restoration projects through a mix of **peer-review** of other student projects and *evaluation* of real-world projects.
3. <a id="5340_LO3"></a>  Build a working *understanding* of the typical **process** through which restoration projects are conceived, proposed, planned, permitted and conceptually designed. 
4. <a id="5340_LO4"></a>  *Identify* and *document* specific **watershed or ecosystem impairments** in relationship to pre-defined management objectives.
5. <a id="5340_LO5"></a>  Objectively *evaluate* and *analyze* the scientific, political, economic and feasibility **tradeoffs of various approaches to restoration** in a specific project context and gain an appreciation of working with diverse stakeholders. *Synthesize* this analysis through a **planning process** that **prioritizes specific restoration and management actions** throughout a watershed.
6. <a id="5340_LO6"></a>  *Develop* a **vision for a restoration project** and *propose* that solution formally.
7. <a id="5340_LO7"></a>  *Identify* and *prepare* forms and applications to appropriate regulatory agencies for a specific project to gain appreciation of **legal and permitting** aspects of projects.
8. <a id="5340_LO8"></a>  *Create* **conceptual design alternatives** for a specific restoration action.


### WATS 5350 - Capstone II

Learning Outcomes include:

1. <a id="5350_LO1"></a> Gain direct experience *applying* knowledge as a watershed scientist to working on real-world aquatic ecosystem **restoration and management problems** (e.g. stream restoration, watershed management,wetland restoration) with practitioners. 
2. <a id="5350_LO2"></a> Provide constructively critical *evaluations* of various aspects ofrestoration projects through a mix of **peer-review** of other student projects and *evaluation* of real-world projects.
3. <a id="5350_LO3"></a> Build a working *understanding* of the typical **process** through which restoration projects are designed, constructed, evaluated and adaptively managed. 
4. <a id="5350_LO4"></a> Develop a working *understanding* of different aspects and approaches to **restoration design** and *create* two types of design and *evaluate* their ability to achieve project objectives. *Articulate* specific, testable **design hypotheses** for your own designs.
5. <a id="5350_LO5"></a> *Develop* a pragmatic **Adaptive Management Plan** for a real project.
6. <a id="5350_LO6"></a> Get first-hand experience **constructing & implementing** a ‘cheap and cheerful’ restoration project by *building* structures you *designed*.
7. <a id="5350_LO7"></a> Understand the principles of **Post Project Appraisals and Monitoring** and how to evaluate overall restoration objectives and test design hypotheses. 
8. <a id="5350_LO8"></a> *Apply* the evaluation and adjust loops of an **Adaptive Management Plan ** to see how the process of learning-by-doing can work.
