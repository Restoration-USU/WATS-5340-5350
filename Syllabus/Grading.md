In both courses, a mix of individual and group assignments  will account for 80% of your grade with assignment weightings proportional to workload. . There will be no tests. All assignments will require producing those materials that professionals and practitioners would normally prepare.  Each group will produce a final project report and make an oral presentation. 20% of your grade will be based on peer-reviews you provide of project documents and constructive critiques of each otherâ€™s projects.
