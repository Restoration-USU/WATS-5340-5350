Welcome to the MRAE Capstone Course Website! The primary audience for this site are the students enrolled in WATS 5340 & WATS 5350 at Utah State University. However, the resources found here may be of general interest to a broader ecosystem management and restoration community, including practitioners, managers, stakeholders and researchers.

For students enrolled, all course materials can be found on this site, whereas you will submit assignments, track your grades and engage in collaborations on our [Canvas Course Pages](https://usu.instructure.com/courses/468472)
